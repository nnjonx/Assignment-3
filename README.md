# Assignment-3
Johnny Nguyen

To run the code for question 1 and 2, place the CS-303 Assignment 3 part 1 and 2.cpp and part1_2.h files into a compiler.
Similarly, to run the code for question 5, place the CS-303 Assignment 3 part 5.cpp and stateDataMap.h files into a compiler.

Here is an example of an output with the part 1 & 2 code: ![part1 2 ss](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113650373/205835934-7c0595a0-f71e-465d-bc41-98a74e283908.png)



Here is an example of an output with the part 5 code:![part 5 ss](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113650373/205836351-a57cc550-853f-4c3d-b500-e3b6d336f985.png)


I have done questions 3 and 4 on a word document that I will attach with the files. The "CS-303_Assignment_3_question_3__4.docx"
